Overhand Knot Tying
Form a loop and pass the end through it. Tighten it to form the Overhand Knot. When pulled tight it can function as a simple stopper knot.

Uses: The Overhand Knot was described by Ashley (ABOK # 46, p 14) as "the simplest of the Single-Strand Stopper Knots." It can also be used to prevent the end of a piece of rope unraveling.




Square Knot (Reef Knot) Tying
Take two ropes and cross them (red over blue) to form a half knot. Cross them a second time (red over blue again) and pull the ends tight to form the Square Knot

Uses: Nevertheless, the Square (Reef) knot has many uses but not where safety is critical, e.g., you can tie a sail cover over a sail; you can tie the string on a gift; and you can tie the laces on your shoes (if they still come with laces). It is also one of the many knots used in macrame. More importantly, the experience of tying a Square Knot teaches the fundamental process of tying a Half Knot or Half Hitch.

Slip Knot Tying
Form a loop in the end of the rope. Prepare a bight in the short end. Tuck the bight through the loop and tighten. The knot can be used as temporary stopper knot.

Uses: The slip knot (ABOK # 529, p 87) is identical in structure to the Noose Knot except that the bight to be inserted is formed from the short end – not the long. It is one of the most frequently tied knots - being used in knitting as the first loop when casting on – where it is called a slip knot but frequently tied as a noose. It can be used as a temporary stopper knot - as shown in the animation.

Figure 8 (Flemish) Knot Tying
Pass the tail over itself to form a loop. Continue under and around the standing end. Complete the knot by passing the tail down through the loop.

Uses: The Figure 8 (ABOK # 570, p 95.) provides a quick and convenient stopper knot to prevent a line sliding out of sight, e.g., up inside the mast. Its virtue is that, even after it has been jammed tightly against a block, it doesn't bind; it can be undone easily. This virtue is also, occasionally, a vice. The figure 8 can fall undone and then has to be retied.
