			<h2>Welcome to our simple knot tutorial site.</h2>
			<br>
			<h3>Why knots?</h3>
			<p>We have created a sample webpage to help with teaching some knots that have been used throughout history. Most of used already know how to tie some simple knots, such as tying our shoes or making a ribbon on a present.</p>
			<p>Knots are incredibly helpful in a multitude of situations to secure things. They can be helpful around the home, vehicles, sports, and the outdoors. Especially when you get in that annoying teardown situation where the knot tightened so much it is near impossible to untie. When it could have just been a slip knot and pulled free much easier.</p>
			<p>This page will help in teaching how to tie some other knots and what situation they can be best put into use for. Everyone learns differently so we have included both a diagram and video explanation for each knot.</p>
			<p>As time permits new knots will be added to the catalog so feel free to check back often.</p>
